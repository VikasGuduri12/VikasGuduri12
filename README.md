today we have learnt about the behaviours of R,L, and C i ac circuits of unit 2
1) in that we leart about the purely resistive circuit , power wave form i purely resistve ckt
2) purely capacitive ckt its formulas and proofs 
3) we learnt series RL- ckt its proffs ad formula and proofs , sreies R-C ckt Series R-L-C ckt and its cases
4) in unit three we learnt about MOSFET, its classification, working principles, construction of MOSFET,characteristics of MOSFET
5) we learnt about op-amp ,inverting op-amp ,its features ,virtual groud concept annd its inverting configuration
